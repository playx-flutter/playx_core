## Configuration

| Guide | What it covers |
| --- | --- |
| [Environment configuration](env.md) | `PlayxEnv`: `.env` files, environments and flavors, `--dart-define`, typed getters, required keys. |
| [Secure env](secure-env.md) | Encrypting sensitive values with the `secure_env` command, CI/CD setup, threat model. |

| [CI/CD samples](https://github.com/playx-flutter/playx_core/tree/main/doc/ci) | Ready-made Codemagic, GitHub Actions and Vercel configurations. |

## Example app

The [example app](https://github.com/playx-flutter/playx_core/tree/main/example) is a runnable project using `PlayxPrefs` and `PlayxEnv` with environments, build-time defines and secure env.

## Conventions used in these guides

- **`maybeGet*` and `get*`.** Every typed getter in the package comes in two forms: `maybeGetX(key)` returns `null` when there is no usable value, and `getX(key, fallback: ...)` returns a default instead.
- **Unscaled numbers.** Layout helpers such as `16.p` use the raw number. Apps using a scaling package (for example `flutter_screenutil`) scale the number first: `16.r.p`.
- **Examples assume** `import 'package:playx_core/playx_core.dart';`, which exports everything documented here.
